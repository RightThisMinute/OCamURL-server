### Known Issues ###

#### Parameter count mismatch ####
In `Lib.Schema.Generate_alias_mut.insert_alias_with_unique_name` runs into
an error when trying to insert a duplicate name:
  
> Failure "exec: (0) parameter count mismatch"

I'm not sure exactly what causes it, but if in `generate_name` of the same
module has `Unix.gettimeofday` changed to `Unix.time` and the `generateAlias`
endpoint is queried consecutive times very quickly (maybe within a second,
before `Unix.time` returns something different than the previous query)
this error shows up.

I've tried reproducing it in a context outside of this GraphQL app, but have
not had success yet.
